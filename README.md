## 🧪 How It Works

### PHQ-9 Assessment Flow

1. **User starts conversation**: Bot greets and explains the assessment
2. **9 Questions asked**: Each question measures depression symptoms over past 2 weeks
3. **User selects frequency**: 
   - Not at all (0 points)
   - Several days (1 point)
   - More than half the days (2 points)
   - Nearly every day (3 points)
4. **Score calculation**: Total score ranges from 0-27
5. **Severity classification**:
   - 0-4: No depression
   - 5-9: Mild depression
   - 10-14: Moderate depression
   - 15-19: Moderately severe depression
   - 20-27: Severe depression
6. **Personalized response**: Bot provides appropriate recommendations
7. **Resources shared**: Crisis hotlines, self-care tips, professional help options
